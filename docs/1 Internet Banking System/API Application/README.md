**Level 3: Component diagram**

Next you can zoom in and decompose each container further to identify the major structural building blocks and their interactions.

The Component diagram shows how a container is made up of a number of "components", what each of those components are, their responsibilities and the technology/implementation details.

**Scope**: A single container.

**Primary elements**: Components within the container in scope.
Supporting elements: Containers (within the software system in scope) plus people and software systems directly connected to the components.

**Intended audience**: Software architects and developers.
